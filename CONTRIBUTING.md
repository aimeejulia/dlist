# Contributing to dList

> We welcome feature requests and bug reports. Please read these guidelines before submitting one.

## Get familiar with the code

We encourage you to download the project and get familiar with the code and the current functionality before you start. If you have questions get in touch.

## Get familiar with git & github

1. **Get git** If you've never worked with git don't worry, follow this [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
If you still need help leave us a message
2. **Fork it!** We advise you to follow the [fork instructions on github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
3. **Consider a git & github integrated text editor** [Atom](https://atom.io/) is an open source text editor with git and github integration that allows you to seemlessly do all the pushing and pulling from within the editor itself.
4. **Join the github community** There is plenty of [help](https://github.community/) out there

## Reporting Issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the code. Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** Please check if someone else has reported the same issue.
2. **Test with the latest version**. Could it be that you are not using the latest version? Make sure you use the latest version to find out.
3. **Include an example.** Examples help eliminate misunderstandings, include screenshots and code snippets where possible.
4. If you have a solution or suggestion for how to fix the bug you're reporting, please include it, or make a pull request - don't assume the maintainers know how to fix it just because you do.

## Feature Requests

* Please search for existing feature requests first to see if something similar already exists.
* Include a clear and specific use-case. We love new ideas.
* Consider whether your request fits into the scope / user story of the app

## Become a contributor
If you want to take an issue just add a small comment saying you are having a go at something, so we don't get duplication. You will be invited to a dev group chat for discussion and added on to the contributors list.

### Pull Requests

_Pull requests are encouraged!_

* Start by adding a feature request to get feedback and see how your idea is received.
* If your pull request solves an existing issue, but it's different in some way, _please create a new issue_ and make sure to discuss it with the core contributors. Otherwise you risk your hard work being rejected.

### Before you start coding

* Go to the project tab and mark the issue you want to work on as in progress, this will help reduce duplication of effort / work.

### Coding Standards

* Include comments in your code, describe in detail what the code does to help future maintainers to edit & or update the code.
